# Synthetic Data Agent

An agentic AI system to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for LLM training with web search grounding, accuracy validation, and copyright compliance.

## Overview

The Synthetic Data Agent is a comprehensive system that leverages agentic AI to generate high-quality synthetic datasets specifically designed for LLM training. The system emphasizes web search grounding, rigorous accuracy validation, and strict copyright compliance to ensure datasets are suitable for distribution on platforms like Hugging Face.

### Key Features

- **Web Search Grounding**: Leverages real-time web search to ground synthetic data in factual information
- **Accuracy Validation**: Multi-layer validation pipeline to ensure data quality and factual correctness
- **Copyright Compliance**: Comprehensive attribution system and copyright validation for safe distribution
- **Customizable Output**: Flexible generation engine supporting various data formats and domains
- **Fact-Checking Pipeline**: Automated validation and verification of generated content

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Search and Ranking Agent**: Performs web searches and ranks information by relevance and reliability
2. **Generation Engine**: Creates synthetic data with customizable parameters and output formats
3. **Validation Pipeline**: Multi-stage fact-checking and quality assurance system
4. **Attribution System**: Tracks sources and ensures proper attribution for copyright compliance

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CodeHalwell/synthetic-data-agent.git
cd synthetic-data-agent

# Install dependencies (coming soon)

```

## Usage

*Note: Detailed usage instructions will be provided as the system develops.*

### Quick Start

```python
# Example usage (coming soon)
from synthetic_data_agent import DataAgent

agent = DataAgent()
dataset = agent.generate(
    domain="scientific_facts",
    size=1000,
    validation_level="strict"
)
```

- **Copyright Validation**: Automated checks ensure compliance with copyright laws
- **Licensing**: Generated datasets are clearly licensed for appropriate use
- **Transparency**: Full disclosure of generation methods and source materials

## GitHub Copilot and AI Assistant Instructions

### Usage Guidelines

When working with this repository using GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants:

1. **Code Generation**: Focus on generating code that follows our established patterns and architecture
2. **Documentation**: Maintain consistency with existing documentation style and structure
3. **Testing**: Generate comprehensive tests for all new functionality
4. **Attribution**: Ensure all AI-generated code includes appropriate comments and attribution

### Limitations

- AI assistants should not generate code that violates copyright or licensing terms
- Always review AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Validate that generated code follows project coding standards

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- Be specific about the component you're working on (search agent, generator, validator, etc.)
- Include context about the system's focus on accuracy and copyright compliance
- Specify the target output format when generating data structures
- Reference existing code patterns and architecture when requesting modifications
